# parcel-plugin-shebang
> #!/usr/bin/env node

Do you want your bundles generated by Parcel to have a shebang? This plugin allows this. You can build CLI applications in a simple way.

## Installing

To install the plugin simply download the module. You can use Yarn or npm for this. After successful installation, you can go to the plugin configuration section.

```shell
yarn add -D parcel-plugin-shebang  # Yarn
npm i -D parcel-plugin-shebang     # npm
```

## Configuration

his plugin requires a small configuration for its operation. The configuration of the plugin must be in the `shebang` section of the `package.json` file.

----------------------

`shebang` section must be an **array** of objects.<br>
The **object** should consist of two keys with the names:
- `interpreter`: `string` - name of interpreter (e.g. `node`, `python`).
- `files`: `string[]` - array of relative paths to the files in which the interpreter is to be used.

> An array can contain many objects. If the path to the file repeats in the next object, the interpreter from the first passed object containing the given file will be used.

#### A simple example:
```json
...

"shebang": [
  {
    "interpreter": "node",
    "files": [
      "./cli.ts"
    ]
  }
]

...
```

#### Now if you run the command:

```shell
parcel build ./cli.ts
```

The resulting file should contain a shebang with a `node` interpreter.
